            "\n",
            "Explanation:\n",
            "- The text mentions a \"temple\", which, while not exclusive to one region or culture, is more commonly associated with specific cultural and religious practices (e.g., Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, or Shinto traditions) prevalent in certain regions, particularly in Asia.\n",
            "- The context of wearing leather shoes \"inside a temple\" is culturally significant because, in many Eastern cultures and religions (notably Hinduism and Sikhism), wearing leather shoes inside a temple is considered disrespectful or taboo due to the sacred nature of the space and the association of leather with animal products. This implies a regional or cultural specificity tied to traditions where temples are common and such customs are observed.\n",

            "Test Phrase : मैं मंदिर के अंदर चमड़े के जूते पहनना चाहता हूं। \n",
            "Cultural Classification: **Specific**\n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation:\n",
            "- The text is written in Hindi (मैं मंदिर के अंदर चमड़े के जूते पहनना चाहता हूं), which is a specific language primarily associated with India and Nepal, indicating a regional/cultural tie.\n",
            "- The mention of \"मंदिर\" (mandir), meaning temple, while not exclusive to one region, is particularly prevalent in Hindu and some Buddhist contexts, commonly found in countries like India, Nepal, and other parts of South Asia. This context suggests a cultural specificity towards these regions or the Hindu/Buddhist cultural sphere.\n",
            "- The concern about wearing \"चमड़े के जूते\" (chamde ke jute), or leather shoes, inside a temple, is notable. In many Hindu temples, there is a prevalent custom of removing shoes before entering the inner sanctum as a sign of respect and purity, with leather being particularly noteworthy due to its animal origin and potential for being considered impure in some contexts. This practice is more common in South Asian cultures, especially in Hindu and Jain traditions, pointing to cultural specificity.\n",

            "\n",
            "Explanation: \n",
            "- The term \"Social Security card\" is specific to the United States, as it refers to a unique identification document issued by the U.S. Social Security Administration.\n",
            "- The context of needing such a document for job purposes, while common in the U.S., does not generalize across all cultures or regions but the specificity here directly ties to a country (USA) rather than being universally applicable.\n",
            "- The question's core issue (seeking employment with a particular identification document) could theoretically apply to other regions with their own identification requirements, but the explicit mention of a \"Social Security card\" anchors it to the United States.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Revised Response to Align with Instructions:**\n",
            "Since the initial explanation leaned towards identifying a specific country (USA) due to the \"Social Security card\" mention, the accurate classification should reflect this regional specificity.\n",
